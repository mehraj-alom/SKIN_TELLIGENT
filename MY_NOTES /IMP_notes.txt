UPDATE THE DETECTOR MODEL :#MUST BE FIXED 
                          1. Even at conf = 0.2 and prob thhess = 0.1 amd NMS thresh  = 70 
                             TN is so high 
##### URGENT ##
if Detection fails the image isn,t gpoing for preediction ( excellent) - but why ??
             - > coz ditection is weak . need to update the detection modal 


## fix: ***urgent 
      in pipeline.py run_image (look for comment , no detection found )
       --> FIX : output_img, crops , classification_result  = pipeline.run()
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

            FIXED : THE image sent for classificcation even wuthouty detection btt but 

       --> ITS A  MANDATORY ERROR (FEATURE) :
                     # This should be there coz {
                        1. If the image isnt related to skin disease then it should't sent for the classification
                     }
