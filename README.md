SKIN_TELLIGENT
Smart dermatology assistant that identifies affected regions and classifies skin conditions using deep learning built for accessible, early skin health screening

🧠 SKIN_TELLIGENT — Detection + Classification Pipeline
A modular, config-driven YOLO-based detection pipeline for dermatological image analysis.
Performs object detection, ROI extraction, and visualization of skin regions using OpenCV’s DNN. now extended with a classification modeule that analyses each detected ROI to identify specific skin diseases .

🚀 Features
Configurable via YAML
Modular classes: Detector, ROIExtractor, Visualizer , Classifier
Centralized logging and structured outputs
Automatic ROI cropping & saving
Integrated classification for detected skin regions using PyTorch models (.pth)
Ready for extension (MLflow, AWS)
🧩 Recent Updates
Added Classifier module — runs on cropped regions from YOLO detections
Enhanced pipeline to perform end-to-end Detection + Disease Classification
FastAPI integration for real-time inference
Future updates: improved inference speed, better UI, and health-risk scoring , Masking for more detailed , VIT (in place of classfier ) , ensemble method , multi modal inference
🧭 Note

This project is under active development. The final README, detailed model documentation, and project motivation will be added soon.
